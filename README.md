# Graphics1-eleonar1

This was a final project for CS120: Advanced Programming

We created a FlappyBird imitation using C++ and GLUT. We were given some of the framework code but
I wrote Triangle.h and Triangle.cpp entirely by myself, as well as the majority of the main function.
I also implemented the wing flapping animation entirely by myself using the Triangle class that I wrote.

Game Instructions:
Up arrow key to fly the bird up, down key to fly down. Don't hit the pipes or your run will end!

Good luck!
